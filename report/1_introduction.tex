\section{Introduction}
Modeling user behavior on a search engine result page is important for understanding the users and supporting simulation experiments.
As result pages become more complex, click models evolve as well in order to capture additional aspects of user behavior in response to new forms of result presentation.
In recent years many models have been proposed that are aimed at predicting clicks of web search users. 
In this report, we will implement and evaluate different click models using evaluation metrics.
These click models include dependent click model (DCM) \cite{Guo2009}, dynamic bayesian network click model (DBN) \cite{Chapelle2009}, user browsing model (UBM) \cite{Dupret2008}, and task-centric click model (TCM) \cite{Zhang2011}.
The evaluation metrics include likelihood, perplexity, click through rate prediction, relevance prediction, computation time and ranking performance.
Our experiment was done using Yandex click log \cite{yandex}.
By doing this experiment we can know the performance of different click model and this information can be used as a benchmark of the next click model proposal.
