%Conclusion
In this paper we have shown that a clear evaluation platform or a universal benchmark is useful and necessary in the creation of new click models. The evaluation measures used to evaluate the click models that were used gave some important insight into how the models work. In our implementation we have made some simplifications to the click models that we believe were correct and we have shown that the models with these simplifications can perform on the same level as UBM, a state-of-the-art click model.
