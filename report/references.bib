abstract = {Many tasks that leverage web search users' implicit feedback rely on a proper and unbiased interpretation of user clicks. Previous eye-tracking experiments and studies on explaining position-bias of user clicks provide a spectrum of hypotheses and models on how an average user examines and possibly clicks web documents returned by a search engine with respect to the submitted query. In this paper, we attempt to close the gap between previous work, which studied how to model a single click, and the reality that multiple clicks on web documents in a single result page are not uncommon. Specifically, we present two multiple-click models: the independent click model (ICM) which is reformulated from previous work, and the dependent click model (DCM) which takes into consideration dependencies between multiple clicks. Both models can be efficiently learned with linear time and space complexities. More importantly, they can be incrementally updated as new click logs flow in. These are well-demanded properties in reality. We systematically evaluate the two models on click logs obtained in July 2008 from a major commercial search engine. The data set, after preprocessing, contains over 110 thousand distinct queries and 8.8 million query sessions. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the gain of modeling multiple clicks and their dependencies. Finally, we note that since our experimental setup does not rely on tweaking search result rankings, it can be easily adopted by future studies.},

@article{Chapelle2009,
	abstract = {As with any application of machine learning, web search ranking requires labeled data. The labels usually come in the form of relevance assessments made by editors. Click logs can also provide an important source of implicit feed- back and can be used as a cheap proxy for editorial labels. The main difficulty however comes from the so called posi- tion bias â€” urls appearing in lower positions are less likely to be clicked even if they are relevant. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Bayesian Network which aims at pro- viding us with unbiased estimation of the relevance from the click logs. Experiments show that the proposed click model outperforms other existing click models in predicting both click-through rate and relevance. Categories},

@article{Zhang2011,
	abstract = {Recent advances in search users' click modeling consider both users' search queries and click/skip behavior on documents to infer the user's perceived relevance. Most of these models, including dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) and user browsing models (UBM), use probabilistic models to understand user click behavior based on individual queries. The user behavior is more complex when her actions to satisfy her information needs form a search session, which may include multiple queries and subsequent click behaviors on various items on search result pages. Previous research is limited to treating each query within a search session in isolation, without paying attention to their dynamic interactions with other queries in a search session. Investigating this problem, we consider the sequence of queries and their clicks in a search session as a task and propose a task-centric click model\~{}(TCM). TCM characterizes user behavior related to a task as a collective whole. Specifically, we identify and consider two new biases in TCM as the basis for user modeling. The first indicates that users tend to express their information needs incrementally in a task, and thus perform more clicks as their needs become clearer. The other illustrates that users tend to click fresh documents that are not included in the results of previous queries. Using these biases, TCM is more accurately able to capture user search behavior. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that by considering all the task information collectively, TCM can better interpret user click behavior and achieve significant improvements in terms of ranking metrics of NDCG and perplexity.},

@article{Dupret2008,
	abstract = {Search engine click logs provide an invaluable source of relevance information but this information is biased because we ignore which documents from the result list the users have actually seen before and after they clicked. Otherwise, we could estimate document relevance by simple counting. In this paper, we propose a set of assumptions on user browsing behavior that allows the estimation of the probability that a document is seen, thereby providing an unbiased estimate of document relevance. To train, test and compare our model to the best alternatives described in the Literature, we gather a large set of real data and proceed to an extensive cross-validation experiment. Our solution outperforms very significantly all previous models. As a side effect, we gain insight into the browsing behavior of users and we can compare it to the conclusions of an eye-tracking experiments by Joachims et al. [12]. In particular, our findings confirm that a user almost always see the document directly after a clicked document. They also explain why documents situated just after a very relevant document are clicked more often.},
